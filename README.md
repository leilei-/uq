# Ultimate Quake
  Ultimate Quake was Mike Gummelt's classic Quake mod from 1996-1997 that got him a job at Raven Software to work on Hexen II (and BEYOND!!!), leaving many fatal crashes go unfixed for almost a good 20 years :(

  The purpose of this repository is to utilize the ultimate power of online repository services and issue trackers and ultimately fix these crashes as well as complete the original vision of Ultimate Quake.  No new engine should be required (but this could be unavoidable), however a better QC compiler is totally feasible. 

  The license of the code is not Free Software, just making that clear.  It's not my code, so it's not really my call... don't sell/exploit it :) though since most of it is original code it's probably possible to get him to GPL it...slim chance though
  
  This has nothing to do with the 2001 retail bundle containing Quake, Quake II and Quake III Arena.

## General TODO:
- Fix bugs
- Accomplish more of his original ambitions
- Use FRIK_FILE to carry all extended player stats and things so single player/coop might actually be progressing
- Restore all monsters
- Add bots, because let's face it, there ain't going to be anyone willing to play this with you. :(
- Try to manage/refactor some of the effect fluff, like the excessive spawning of bubbles and the flying flames
- Recreate the changes in V5 Beta 5 as the QC code to that has not been released. :(
